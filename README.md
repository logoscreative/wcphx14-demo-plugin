Temporary Cache Assistance (Transients API)
===================

This plugin offers code examples used in my presentation, but in OOP fashion, executed by shortcodes. 

Grab the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/cliffseal/transients-wcphx), install this plugin (or just load it up), and follow along.

Examples include:

1. Caching a tag cloud
1. Caching GitHub Issues
1. Refreshing Transients by Admin Bar Link
1. Caching Big Queries
1. Defeating Race Conditions with Cron
