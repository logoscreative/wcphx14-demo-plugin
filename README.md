Temporary Cache Assistance (Transients API)
===================

This plugin offers code examples used in my presentation, but in OOP fashion, executed by shortcodes. 

Grab the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/cliffseal/transients-wcphx), then:

1. Clone the repo to your plugins directory or download the .zip file.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Import the contained .xml file, which will import five posts with shortcodes that execute the functions.

Examples include:

1. Caching a tag cloud
1. Caching GitHub Issues
1. Refreshing Transients by Admin Bar Link
1. Caching Big Queries
1. Defeating Race Conditions with Cron
